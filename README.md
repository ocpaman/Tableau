# Tableau
Tableau is a software for data visualization.  It was used as part of a course at Udemy for Data Science A-Z.  It was used for plotting graphs and maps for the given data. 
For the final project at Udacity, we created an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. This project is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and our final deliverable is to a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.
